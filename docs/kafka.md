# why

Kafka can be used as an [ingestion option](https://github.com/grafana/metrictank/blob/master/docs/inputs.md) as well as a [clustering transport](https://github.com/grafana/metrictank/blob/master/docs/clustering.md) for metrictank.

# Kafka version

We recommend v2.0.0 or higher, as that is what we use.
Older versions should still work

If you use 0.10.0.0 and want snappy compression, watch out for [kafka-3789](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-3789) as you'll need to do a hack [like this](https://github.com/raintank/raintank-docker/commit/e98883b08f343d896a3333801f16c7a603e89422)
